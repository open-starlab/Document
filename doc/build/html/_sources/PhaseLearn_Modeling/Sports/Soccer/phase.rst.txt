Phase of Play Estimation
=====================

This section defines the target play phases for estimation. The objective is to estimate the probability of each phase for a given match situation, rather than assigning a single label.

Target Play Phases
------------------
The estimation targets are the **9 major Phases of Play** as defined by FIFA. These phases capture the tactical dynamics of a match across different states of possession and defensive organization:

1. **Build up**
2. **Progression**
3. **Final third**
4. **Counter-attack**
5. **High press**
6. **Mid block**
7. **Low block**
8. **Counter-press**
9. **Recovery**

Probability-based Estimation
----------------------------
The framework provides a probability distribution across these nine phases. This allows for a more nuanced analysis, reflecting that modern football situations often blend multiple tactical characteristics.
