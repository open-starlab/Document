Application of the Event Model in Soccer
========================================
This section demonstrates applications of the Event Model in soccer.

Heat Map of the Predicted Next Event Location (Gaussian Smoothed)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following code snippet shows how to use the `Event_Model` class to plot a heat map of the next event location based on model predictions.

.. code-block:: python

    from event import Event_Model  
    import pandas as pd 
    import os
    
    # Initialize the LEM model
    model = Event_Model('LEM', 'path/to/LEM.yaml')
    
    # Set paths for inference data and min-max scaling dictionary
    inference_data_path = 'path/to/inference.csv'
    min_max_dict_path = 'path/to/min_max_dict.json'
    save_path_folder = 'path/to/save'
    
    # Ensure the save path directory exists
    os.makedirs(save_path_folder, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Define the row in the inference data to visualize
    row_num = 100

    # Plot the heat map
    model.plot_heat_map(inference_data_path, min_max_dict_path, save_path_folder, row_num)

The generated heat map will show the predicted next event location based on model inference.

This visualization helps identify potential areas for the next event, making it easier to analyze patterns and trends in soccer gameplay.


Holistic Possession Utilization Score (HPUS) and HPUS+
----------------------------------------------------------

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `Event_Model` class to plot the HPUS score for each 5-minute segment of a match. For a detailed explanation of HPUS and HPUS+, including their formulas, please refer to the `NMSTPP` model paper.

.. code-block:: python

    from event import Event_Model   
    import os
    import pandas as pd

    # Initialize the LEM model
    model = Event_Model('LEM', 'path/to/LEM.yaml')
    
    # Define paths for inference data and min-max scaling dictionary
    inference_data_path = 'path/to/inference.csv'
    min_max_dict_path = 'path/to/min_max_dict.json'
    save_path_folder = 'path/to/save'

    # Ensure the save path directory exists
    os.makedirs(save_path_folder, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Load and filter data for a specific match
    match_id = 3894771
    df = pd.read_csv(inference_data_path)
    df_match = df[df['match_id'] == match_id]

    # Calculate HPUS 
    hpus = model.cal_HPUS(data=df_match, save_path=save_path_folder)

    # Calculate HPUS+ 
    hpus_plus = model.cal_HPUS(data=df_match, save_path=save_path_folder, plus=True)

This visualization shows how effectively the team has realized possession value during each 5-minute segment, offering insights into their attacking performance and overall effectiveness.

Possession Utilization Score (Poss-Util)
----------------------------------------

The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `Event_Model` class to plot the Poss-Util and Poss-Util+ metrics for each team's performance over a specified period. For a detailed explanation of Poss-Util and Poss-Util+, including their formulas, please refer to the `Seq2Event` model paper.

.. code-block:: python

    from event import Event_Model   
    import os
    import pandas as pd

    # Initialize the LEM model
    model = Event_Model('LEM', 'path/to/LEM.yaml')
    
    # Define paths for inference data and min-max scaling dictionary
    inference_data_path = 'path/to/inference.csv'
    min_max_dict_path = 'path/to/min_max_dict.json'
    save_path_folder = 'path/to/save'

    # Ensure the save path directory exists
    os.makedirs(save_path_folder, exist_ok=True)

    # Define specific teams to calculate Poss-Util, or leave empty to calculate for all teams
    teams = ['Real Madrid', 'Athletic Club', 'Deportivo Alav√©s', 'Mallorca', 'Granada'] 
    poss_util = model.cal_poss_util(data=inference_data_path, save_path=save_path_folder, team=teams)
